### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working on creating a blog tutorial to help fellow statisticians to understand difficult concepts. 
I'm learning more about data science and how to contribute to the statistical community efficiently. 
Ask me about questions you might have about R, SAS, SQL, Python, Linux, AWK, or C++! I have basic to intermediate understanding of all of these languages!
Fun fact about me is that I ran a 4:15 mile in high school and still enjoy running to this day!
